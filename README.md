# for this is written to help the user visiting this repository get a insight of the problems of international computer science compettition.

the competition resources are found at  https://icscompetition.org/en/index  where you can explore more about the competition your self.

-> So at first the repository is solving the first two a signed questions for the qaulification round, the one of problem b and that for problem d.

-> For **problem_b** one if just asked to take an input of flour and sugar where a single cake is made from 100 flour and 50 sugar and one is tasked to tell the number of cakes made and the left over flour and suugar as a list, this problem is simply sovlved in O(n) time complpexity which is so good for competition but not limited to that.

-> For the **problem_d** your are tasked to create a word puzzel of 10*10 containing the given words in different kinds of arrangemeent which the codes comments will be explaining more about.

But even if all this are the support from my own skills your are not limited to commenting for suggested changes that can be made in @popodrago repositories
